# Shopping Cart Kata
## Scala Implementation
Implement and Test a system for a supermarket checkout that calculates the total price of scanned items.

Items are priced individually but special offers may apply on certain items. Offers apply when multiple items are purchased together, although they can be scanned out of order. BOGOF is Buy One Get One Free.
